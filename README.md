**HANDWRITTEN CHARACTER RECOGNITION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS**

Overview: Recognizing Handwritten character (alphabets or Numeric) using CNN

Data sets used:
**i. A_Z Handwritten data set from Kaggle
ii. MNIST dataset :  from Sklearn.datasets import load_digits**

The project is done under three notebooks . First notebook contains data pre-processing part where the two data sets are merged and pre-processed. Second Notebook shows algorithm implementation part using Convolutional Neural Network. Finally, Third Notebook shows application running code to test real-time handwritten character using stylus or mouse.

**Software Requirements:**
1. python 3.5
2. tensorflow 1.2.1
3. keras
4. matplotlib
5. scikit-learn
